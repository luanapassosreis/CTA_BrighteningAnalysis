# Project Description

CTA_BrighteningAnalysis is an analysis of the sources filtered by Paolo Goldoni from the 4LAC Fermi-LAT Catalog. This can be useful for the AGN Population Task Force and also the AGN Flares Task Forces of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Collaboration.


## Installation
 
This package can be installed by downloading it:

```
git clone git@github.com:luanapassosreis/CTA_BrighteningAnalysis.git

```

You must change the path in \_\_init\_\_ and set it to this folder on your computer (CTA_BrighteningAnalysis/ folder)

>> \_\_init\_\_.ipynb << Initial imports, functions and dataframes for the 4LAC Analysis

From that point on, you can reproduce all plots/analysis, by opening the following files:

>> Fvar_sources.ipynb << F_var analysis for the sources on 4LAC Catalog

>> Plot_lightcurves_and_spectrum.ipynb << Light Curve and Spectrum Plots of a chosen range of sources from the 4LAC Catalog

>> Histogram_analys.ipynb << Histogram Analysis of the 4LAC Catalog
